# NetLogo-MazeExploration

A simulation of maze traversal using single and multiple agents in NetLogo, demonstrating agent-based behavior in a generated maze. The system supports various exploration modes including deterministic and random pathfinding, as well as branching multi-agent logic.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Maze generation using **Kruskal’s Algorithm**
- ✅ Supports three exploration modes:
  - **Single-Deterministic**: Wall-following, deterministic navigation
  - **Single-Random**: Randomized decision making
  - **Multiple-Agent**: Explorers hatch and divide at junctions
- ✅ Left-hand wall-following logic
- ✅ Simple agent graphics with visible paths
- ✅ Exit detection and halting upon reaching the goal

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Agent-based modeling  
- Maze representation via graphs  
- Pathfinding strategies  
- Turtle mobility and decision making  
- Recursive agent hatching at junctions
