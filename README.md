# NetLogo-Maze-Exploration

🧭 NetLogo Maze Exploration
A simulation of maze traversal using single and multiple agents in NetLogo, demonstrating agent-based behavior in a generated maze. The system supports various exploration modes including deterministic and random pathfinding, as well as branching multi-agent logic.

🚀 Features
✅ Maze generation using Kruskal’s Algorithm

✅ Supports three exploration modes:

Single-Deterministic: Wall-following, deterministic navigation

Single-Random: Randomized decision making

Multiple-Agent: Explorers hatch and divide at junctions

✅ Left-hand wall-following logic

✅ Simple agent graphics with visible paths

✅ Exit detection and halting upon reaching the goal

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
Agent-based modeling

Maze representation via graphs

Pathfinding strategies

Turtle mobility and decision making

Recursive agent hatching at junctions
